# AI Sandbox Development Environment Testing Framework

**Core Testing Areas and Requirements**

Reproducibility is Key: We need to design tests that yield similar results across executions, focusing on deterministic code and sandbox setups.

1. **Environment Testing**
   - Isolation: Verify sandbox environments are truly isolated
   - Reproducibility: Ensure consistent environment creation
   - Dependency Management: Test package installation across different managers
   - Resource Controls: Verify CPU, memory, and disk space limitations

2. **Code Execution Framework**
   - Multi-language Support: Test execution in various programming languages
   - Security Boundaries: Verify sandbox containment
   - Performance Metrics: Measure execution times and resource usage
   - Error Handling: Validate proper capture and reporting of failures

3. **Task Completion Testing**
   - Real-world Workflows: Test complete development scenarios
   - Multi-stage Tasks: Setup, execution, and validation phases
   - Success Rate Tracking: Measure completion rates beyond timing
   - Output Validation: Verify correct execution results

**Implementation Requirements**

1. **Standardised Test Case Structure**
For each issue (test case), define a JSON-based test spec with:
   - A detailed prompt that an agent has to complete.
   - Expected outcome: either an output or a pass/fail condition based on test runs.
   - Required dependencies: specify the environment requirements using a standard interface (like requirements.txt or environment.yml).
   - Optional test suite: code with various tests that can be used to evaluate the quality of code.
   - Expected execution speed benchmark.

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Execution timing
   - Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Success/failure rates
   - Error categorization
   - Setup time measurements

3. **Testing Categories**
   - Environment consistency tests
   - Dependency conflict scenarios
   - Resource limit testing
   - Security boundary verification
   - Concurrent execution tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Timeout handling

4. **Reporting Requirements**
   - Structured output format
   - Detailed error logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource usage statistics
   - Test suite results
   - Comparative analysis capabilities

5. **Error Handling Requirements**
   - Capture setup failures
   - Track execution errors
   - Report resource exhaustion
   - Log dependency issues
   - Document security violations

**Advanced Testing Features**

1. **Multi-stage Evaluation Process**
   - Environment setup validation
   - Code execution verification
   - Output validation
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Performance measurement

2. **Comprehensive Testing Scenarios**
   - New project setup
   - Package publishing
   - Multi-file editing
   - Multi-commit workflows
   - Iterative development cycles

3. **Resource Management**
   - Peak usage monitoring
   - Average usage tracking
   - Concurrent load testing
   - Resource limit verification
   - Cleanup validation

This specification provides a framework for building a robust testing suite that evaluates sandbox providers across multiple dimensions, focusing on real-world usability, reliability, and performance metrics.

**Brainstorming Test Ideas (Inspired by SWE-bench):**

1. **Environment Consistency Tests:**
    *   **Idea:** Create a set of test scripts that install a variety of packages (with specific versions) and then verify that the correct versions are installed.
    *   **Example:** Have a script install `numpy==1.23.0`, then have a separate script check if that exact version is available.
    *   **Inspiration:** SWE-bench's reliance on specific versions in its installation specs.

2. **Resource Limit Tests:**
    *   **Idea:** Write scripts that consume increasing amounts of CPU, memory, or disk space.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **CPU:** Run a computationally intensive loop.
        *   **Memory:** Allocate large arrays or data structures.
        *   **Disk:** Create very large files.
    *   **Verification:** Check that the sandbox correctly terminates the execution when limits are exceeded and provides informative error messages.

3. **Security Boundary Tests:**
    *   **Idea:** Attempt to escape the sandbox or access restricted resources.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Try to access files outside the designated sandbox directory.
        *   Try to make network requests to external servers (unless this is explicitly allowed).
        *   Try to execute system commands that should be blocked.
    *   **Inspiration:** SWE-bench's use of Docker containers for isolation.

4. **Concurrent Execution Tests:**
    *   **Idea:** Run multiple sandbox instances simultaneously, each executing different code.
    *   **Example:** Have multiple instances installing different packages, running computationally intensive tasks, or writing to files concurrently.
    *   **Verification:** Check for resource contention issues, race conditions, and ensure that the sandboxes remain properly isolated.
    *   **Inspiration:** SWE-bench's use of `multiprocessing.Pool` in `run_evaluation.py`

5. **Performance Benchmarking Tests:**
    *   **Idea:** Measure the time it takes to perform common operations (e.g., sandbox creation, code execution, package installation).
    *   **Example:** Create a set of benchmark scripts that perform common tasks (e.g., numerical computation, data processing, web requests) and time their execution.
    *   **Inspiration:** SWE-bench's focus on evaluating the performance of models (although the performance of the platform itself is also a factor).

6. **API/UI Testing:**
    *   **Idea:** If the sandbox provider has an API, write tests to cover all endpoints, checking for correct responses, error handling, and authentication.
    *   **Example:** Use tools like `pytest` or `requests` to interact with the API.
    *   **Idea:** If there's a UI, perform usability testing and ensure that all features work as expected.
    *   **Example:** Use tools like Selenium or Cypress for UI testing.

7. **Timeouts:**
    *   **Idea:** Verify how the sandbox handles tasks that run for an extended period.
    *   **Example:** Make sure that long running tasks are terminated at a certain time as defined by the provider.
