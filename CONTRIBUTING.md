- Add type hints to your Python code
- Include docstrings for public functions and classes

### Test Guidelines

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the template in `tests/test_template.py`
2. Ensure your test is well-documented with clear docstrings
3. Make sure your test works with all providers
4. Include a description of what your test measures in the test's docstring

### Provider Integration

When adding a new provider:

1. Create a new Python file in the `providers/` directory
2. Implement the required interface matching existing providers
3. Update the provider documentation in `providers/README.md`
